### overview
thread is a lightweight sub process
a thread is created & controlled by the java.lang.Thread class
```bash
jvm
├── daemon thread
├── main thread
|   ├── child thread 1
|   └── child thread 2 
|       ├── child thread 3          
└── ...
```

### thread lifecycle
```
state: New  
state: Runable
state: Running
state: Waiting
state: Terminated

New --> Runnable
Runnable --> Running
Running --> Terminated
Running --> Runnable
Running --> Waiting
Waiting --> Runnable
```

### creating a thread
#### Thread class
```java
public class Mythread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // executing statement
    }
}

Mythread obj = new Mythread();
obj.start();
```
#### Runnable Interface
```java
public class Mythread implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // executing statement
    }
}

Thread t = new Thread(new MyThread());
t.start();
```

### sync
- joining threads: join()
- synchronized
