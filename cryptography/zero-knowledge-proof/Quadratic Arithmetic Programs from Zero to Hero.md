# Quadratic Arithmetic Programs: from Zero to Hero

## Function
def qeval(x):
    y = x**3
    return x + y + 5


## Flattening
sym_1 = x * x
y = sym_1 * x
sym_2 = y + x
~out = sym_2 + 5

'~one', 'x', '~out', 'sym_1', 'y', 'sym_2'

## Gates to R1CS
Now, we convert this into something called a rank-1 constraint system (R1CS). An R1CS is a sequence of groups of three vectors (a, b, c), and the solution to an R1CS is a vector s, where s must satisfy the equation s . a * s . b - s . c = 0, where . represents the dot product 
first gate
a = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
b = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
c = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

second gate
a = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
b = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
c = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

third gate 
a = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
b = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
c = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

forth gate
a = [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
b = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
c = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

The complete R1CS put together is:
A
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
B
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
C
[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

## R1CS to QAP
The next step is taking this R1CS and converting it into QAP form, which implements the exact same logic except using polynomials instead of dot products.

Now, letâ€™s use Lagrange interpolation to transform our R1CS. What we are going to do is take the first value out of every a vector, use Lagrange interpolation to make a polynomial out of that (where evaluating the polynomial at i gets you the first value of the ith a vector), repeat the process for the first value of every b and c vector, and then repeat that process for the second values, the third, values, and so on. For convenience I'll provide the answers right now:
A polynomials
[-5.0, 9.166, -5.0, 0.833]
[8.0, -11.333, 5.0, -0.666]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
[-6.0, 9.5, -4.0, 0.5]
[4.0, -7.0, 3.5, -0.5]
[-1.0, 1.833, -1.0, 0.166]
B polynomials
[3.0, -5.166, 2.5, -0.333]
[-2.0, 5.166, -2.5, 0.333]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
